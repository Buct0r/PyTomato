A very simple pomodoro timer made with python

## Functions
A pomodoro timer is a timer inspired by the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The application will allow you to start a 25 minutes timer and during this time you are supposed to work, followed by a short break of 5 minutes. For now, the time for the work period and the break period cannot be changed, but I'm planning on adding this feature in future versions.

## Conlusion
You can download the executable from [here](). Windows Defender or your antivirus will probably block the execution, but you can add an exception in your antivirus settings. If you don't trust the application, you can always check the source code from the main branch of the repo.
